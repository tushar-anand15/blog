      <p>
        I like to tinker around with code and work with data. Although I do not have a formal background in computer science, I've always had an interest in computers and code. This blog is where I share the interesting things I learn about data - from the perspective of a non-engineer.

        Currently, I'm working at Jhana.ai as a data engineer where my work involves web scraping and maintaining the post-processing pipeline for our AI products. Previously, I have held research positions at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, and XKDR Forum where I worked with data as well as legal-policy analysis.

        I hold a master's in Urban Policy and Governance from Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, and a bachelor's in Economics, Political Science, and Sociology from Christ University, Bangalore.
